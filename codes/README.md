# sparsemediation_submission

This folder includes files that were used to generate figures/tables for the manuscript entitled "Sparse mediation analysis" by Seonjoo Lee et. al.

# Directories

1. sim1: Section 3.1 Simulation Setting 1: Independent mediators. 
Since the simulation takes long time to complete, the original code for the simulation (simulation1.R) and their resulting files (*.Rdata) are saved.

2. sim3: Section 3.2 Simulation Setting 3: Different path strength
Since the simulation takes long time to complete, the original code for the simulation (simulation3.R) and their resulting files (*.Rdata) are saved.

3. sim2: Section 3.3 Simulation Setting 2: Correlated mediators
Since the simulation takes long time to complete, the original code for the simulation (simulation2.R) and their resulting files (*.Rdata) are saved.

# Analysis script
1. Section3_Simulation.Rmd/html include the visualization code based on the simulations resutls. 

2. Section4_RANN.Rmd/html include data analysis code for section5.
